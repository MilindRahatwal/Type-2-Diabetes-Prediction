# Type-2-Diabetes-Prediction
Type 2 Diabetes is one of the growing diseases. With 285 million patients with Type 2Diabetes (T2D) in the world so far is said to reach 380 million in the next 15-20 years. As there is no proper cure for this disease an early prediction is necessary. By predicting diabetes at an early stage, an individual can control the disease by changing their diet and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. In this project, we predict T2D with the help of gene expression. T2D is mostly attributed to the failure of pancreatic islet cells. The processing of data in a meaningful and beneficial manner is now possible thanks to modern technologies.The identification of distinctive transcriptional signatures has been made feasible by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).Gene Expressions are the biomarkers chosen for this research. However, implementations of this method have been disappointing, since three separate studies have been unable to demonstrate common differentially expressed genes in T2D -cells. After removing the low-quality cells we compare these 2 studies to see which one gives the best result for the prediction of diabetes. The risk of Type 2 Diabetes is predicted using the Mutual Nearest Neighbours algorithm. We use Mutual Nearest Neighbour (MNN) to reduce the differences between the two available datasets.
